                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a Data Scientist who is passionate about data science and analytics. My background is in Economics and Statistics. While in grad school, I became really interested in Time Series analysis and wrote my master's thesis on causality testing which can be found <a href="https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cc_etds_theses/93/" target="_blank" class="link">here</a>. These days you can find me working on a variety of data science applications in insurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for starting this blog is to share things that I've learned. I'm planning on posting various tutorials which I hope readers will find helpful. Some of them may be more suitable for beginners while others would cover more complex concepts. To be true to my blog's name, I will explore various data sources and post my take on visualizing/analyzing them. From time to time, I will also post miscellaneous things, such as my rambling, links to articles/posts I found helpful and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides data science, I love to spend free time with my cat, CrossFitting and travelling the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm still very new to web development, so for now this is just a static web site that doesn't support commenting, but as I'm learning more about webdev, I'm sure eventually it will have a powerful server side as well. For now, if you'd like to leave a comment or reach out, messaging on LinkedIn would be the best.
                </p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy my Data Science blog!</p>
