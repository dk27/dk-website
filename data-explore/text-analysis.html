                    <h3>October 25th, 2020</h3>
                    <p>I like working with text data. If used correctly, it can improve accuracy of predictive models,
                        and it can be really fun to visualize the contents of articles, tweets, reviews, and so on.
                        Since the last presidential debate took place a few days ago, I thought I'd take a crack at
                        analyzing its transcript. </p>
                    <p>My posts typically use or reference Python, but today I decided to do the analysis in R. Here are
                        the things that I did.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="blue">&check;</span> Imported transcript data from an html page in R</li>
                        <li><span class="blue">&check;</span> Did some basic data cleaning and separated the data by
                            candidate</li>
                        <li><span class="blue">&check;</span> Created word frequency and word cloud charts</li>
                        <li><span class="blue">&check;</span> Looked into word associations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can find my full code <a href="" class="link">Here</a>.</p>
                    <p>I used <a
                            href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-final-presidential-debate-transcript-2020"
                            class="a" target="_blank">www.rev.com transcripts</a> as my data source. It's nicely
                        formatted and not very difficult to work with, you just need to make sure you separate
                        candidates' speeches if you want to look at them individually.</p>
                    <p>I also did some typical data cleaning which consists of removing numbers, punctuation, white
                        spaces, converting every word to lower case, and removing common stopwords that don't have much
                        meaning. This all can be easily achieved with the <code class="code">tm</code> library.</p>
                    <p>A good starting point of text analysis is to look at words frequencies. Sometimes it can shed
                        light on what the text is about, but I can't say
                        that these charts below are very informative. It is interesting that top 3 words for both
                        candidates
                        are "going", "people" and "said" but not very surprising. I guess the only surprising thing is
                        that I'd thought coronavirus or COVID-19 would make it in the top-15.</p>

                    <div class="csv-pull1">
                        <img src="../styles/plot-freq.png" alt="word frequency Trump & Biden">
                    </div>

                    <p>Another way to look at word frequency is by using <b>word clouds</b>. I think that it's a more
                        fun way to visualize word frequencies rather than a bar chart. </p>
                    <p>Joe Biden's word cloud shows that he wasn't using the same words very frequently, and the cloud
                        itself isn't very big. I only included words that appear at least 5 times in his speech. The
                        color and size represent different frequency groups, and we can see 5 clear
                        groups and most of the words are in red. </p>
                    <div class="csv-pull1">
                        <img src="../styles/biden-wordcloud.png" alt="word cloud Biden">
                    </div>
                    <p>Donald Trump's is probably more interesting to interpret. While both Trump and Biden mention
                        "China" a lot (20 and 22 times accordingly), Trump also used "Russia" 20 times in his speech.
                        It's
                        also interesting that we don't see Biden addressing Trump by his first or last name, whereas
                        Trump said "Joe" 31 times. Again, it's surprising not to see "coronavirus" or "COVID-19".
                        Overall, both word clouds seem to be consistent with what I remember from the debate. </p>
                    <div class="csv-pull1">
                        <img src="../styles/trump-wordcloud.png" alt="word cloud Biden">
                    </div>

                    <p>While you can gain some insights from word frequency and word clouds, I really like <code
                            class="code">udpipe</code> library that allows you to look at key words and word
                        associations.</p>
                    <p>We can look at frequencies of various parts of speech although not sure how informative it is.
                        What's probably more interesting is to view most commonly used parts of speech. I first looked
                        at
                        verbs, but the result looked underwhelming. </p>
                    <p>I then looked at nouns which seemed to be more interesting. Both candidates used "people" the
                        most in their speeches. Biden's second most common noun is "fact" whereas Trump's is "money". I
                        think
                        most frequently used adjectives are the most informative.</p>

                    <p><code class="code">Udpipe</code> also allows you to search for keywords. There are multiple
                        methods that you can use, and I chose <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227988510_Automatic_Keyword_Extraction_from_Individual_Documents" class="a" target="_blank">RAKE</a>. Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm
                        utilizes most relevant words and takes into account their
                        frequency and co-occurrences. </p>
                    <p>I'm a little bit surprised about "big man" in Trump's speech and don't quite recall to whom it referred.</p>
                    <div class="grid-bottom">
                        <div class="csv-pull1">

                    <p>The next two charts are my favorites. While word frequencies can be useful, sometimes you may want
                        to know which words follow one another. For instance, "sure" showed up as an important word in
                        Joe Biden's speech. Was it used as "not sure" or "make sure"? That's where the following graphs
                        can be quite helpful. </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see from Biden's word association chart, "sure" is associated with "make sure". It's
                        interesting to see that "make" is also associated with "clear" and "money". "People" is another
                        common word which is associated with "American people", "give people" and "enough". Overall, we can see a lot of associations related to health whether it's wearing a mask or having affordable healthcare.
                    </p>
                    <div class="csv-pull1">
                        <img src="../styles/biden-word-network.png" alt="Biden word network">
                    </div>
                    <p>In Donald Trump's speech, "have" seems to be associated with quite a few words -- "have good
                        relationship", "have school open", etc. There is some reference to money ("make money", "lot money", "million dollar"), energy sector (carbon emissions and oil industry) and "big man" appearing again. </p>
                    <div class="csv-pull1">
                        <img src="../styles/trump-word-network.png" alt="Trump word network">

                    <p>These are just a few ways you can visualize text data. I watched the debate, so I may be biased
                        toward whether it was helpful to understand what candidates talked about. Overall, I think word
                        association and key words charts were representative of the contents of the debate. What did you think?</p>
