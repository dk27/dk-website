            <p>You decided to become a Data Scientist. Now what? </p>
            <p>Over the last few weeks, I saw posts on LinkedIn and Twitter from aspiring data scientists trying
                to get their feet wet in the industry which prompted me to writing this post.</p>
            <p>I don't claim to know it all and my advice may not be applicable to all industries, but from my
                experience and research of other industries, I'm pretty sure at least some of it can be useful.</p>
            <p>If you are an aspiring data scientist and reading this post, continue reading. If you are an experienced
                data scientist and reading this post and there is something that I forgot to mention, feel free to use
                the comment section below (you don't have to sing in, you can leave a comment as a guest).</p>
            <p>Here is a Data Science Road Map for you</p>
            <h3 class="blue">1. Educational Background</h4>
                <p>If you have a degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Math, Economics or other similar areas, you are
                    in luck! Your educational background probably provided you a decent foundation to pursue a Data
                    Science career. Feel free to skip this section. </p>
                <p>If you have a degree in other area, you may have to learn a few additional things, but it's totally
                    doable! I've seen people switching from all sorts of non-technical disciplines to web, software
                    development and data science. How can you suplement an undergraduate or graduate degree?</p>
                <div class="csv-pull">
                    <img src="../styles/71d0ab6e-b520-4e66-b650-3baac10b2f2d.png" alt="My Diagram">
                </div>
                <h4 class="blue">Bootcamp</h4>
                <p> This option would be most comparable to getting a university degree in a data science related area.
                    Quite a few Data Science bootcamps are even offered by universities. They can take up to 6 months to
                    complete, and some have 9-5 schedule which may not work for you if you have a full-time job.</p>
                <p>Bootcamps can also be quite costly although with some providers, you don't have to pay much up front
                    and pay later once you successfully get a data scientist job.</p>
                <p>A similar option would be a certificate degree offered by various universities. This option typically
                    takes less time than a graduate program and costs less. </p>
                <p>How do you find one? I'd recommend checking with your local universities about bootcamp or
                    certificate programs. You can also search for organizations that offer bootcamps. Make sure to check
                    their syllabus, reviews and even better if you talk to people who completed these programs (try
                    finding them on LinkedIn) to see how much they learned and how easy it was for them to get a job
                    after graduation.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blue">In-person classes</h4>
                <p>Let's say you don't want to spend a fortune on a bootcamp or certificate program, but you prefer
                    in-person experience. Your other option is to try searching for evening or weekend courses in your
                    area. There are organizations that provide learning services which you may want to research.</p>
                <p>Another option is to take undergraduate classes form a local university without pursuing a degree. I
                    would be surprised if a data science program would allow you to take a class, but Statistics or
                    Computer Science programs may. </p>
                <p>I haven't taken any in-person Data Science courses, but I did take a Web Development and
                    JavaScript courses from June college in Toronto, and I did enjoy learning something I wasn't
                    familiar with in an in-person environment. I remember looking
                    into General Assembly, but I ended up not pursuing it mainly because of the cost.</p>
                <h4 class="blue">Online courses</h4>
                <p>What if there are no good programs near you or you want to minimize your spending? Your next option
                    is online courses. This option will probably require more time on your end because not only would
                    you need to study, you'll also have to find and organize your coursework. I also don't think it's
                    sufficient to take one online course to pursue a data science carrer. Here is a list of courses that
                    I would suggest looking into that should be enough to get you started.</p>

                <h3 class="blue">2. Skills</h3>
                <p> As a data scientist, you will work on a variety of projects which will require a blend of technical
                    and non-technical skills. </p>
                <h4 class="blue">Data</h4>
                <p>
                    You will need to get familiar with various data sources to be successful. Some of them will be
                    internal and majority will be in a tabular format, example of which would be in relational
                    databases, csv, flat filers. Other intenal data could be in non-tabular format and reside in
                    <b>NoSQL databases</b>, such as document or graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may also work with external data some of which may be publicly available whereas others would
                    come from data vendors. Commonly the data can be supplied to you in tabular format, but for any
                    real-time applications, the data will typically have to be accessed via an API which would require
                    getting comfortable with non-tabular data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will need to be very comfortable with data manipulation including aggregation, different types
                    of joins, filtering, variable creation, and so on. Ultimately, what helps me is knowing what my
                    final data set should look like, so before you start working on a data project, make sure that you
                    know what you are trying to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important non-technical aspect of data that's often overlooked is domain knowledge. You can
                    construct a data set and even feed it to a fully automated machine learning model, but how do you
                    know that the model uses relevant predictors? What if there is an attribute that represents data
                    leakege? What if there is an attribute that's no longer relevant? How would you know which external
                    data may be relevant? These questions can easily be answered if you have domain knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data skills are absolutely necessary for predictive modeling. They are also important for reporting
                    and ad-hoc purposes.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blue">Data Visualization</h4>
                <p>
                    This skill can come handy when you want to produce exploratory data analysis. It's also highly
                    important if some of your projects are related to dashboard creation and reporting. Lastly, you'll
                    most likely need to present your findings to your clients or management, and having compelling,
                    easy-to-interpret data visualizations is necessary.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blue">Predictive Modeling</h4>
                <p>
                    I think many of us pick Data Science to build models. You may work on statistical, machine learning
                    or deep learning models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides knowing how to build a model in Python or R, you should know at least some basic math behind
                    these models and various parameters that can impact the performance of your model. Here are some
                    useful questions you should be able to answer. Do you need a highly accurate model or one that you
                    can easily interpret? How are you going to ensure your model performs well on unseen data? Which
                    model performance metrics you are most interested in? Are there any deployment limitations you may
                    encounter?
                </p>
                <h4 class="blue">Model Deployment</h4>
                <p>
                    This may feel like a more of an IT task, but I'm a strong believer that it's something that needs to
                    be done or at least closely supervised by a data scientist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This skill requires more of a developer's mindset where you need to know best programming practices,
                    potentially cloud architecture, etc.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blue">Monitoring</h4>
                <p>
                    Knowing how to monitor your projects results is also very important. You want to make sure you
                    notice model drift if any as soon as possible. You would also want to monitor for any bugs or erros
                    that end up being in production. Lastly, you'd want to monitor that the model you built performs
                    equally well on new data.
                </p>
                <h4 class="blue">Story telling</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a soft skill that's commonly emphasized. Why is it important? You can have a great highly
                    accurate model, but if you can't explain why your model is important and what business impact it can
                    have, it may never make it into production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowing how to translate technical stuff to a non-technical audience can be very challenging. I
                    remember someone asking me in grad school, how I would explain what a linear regression is to a
                    9-year old and my first instinct was to talk about coefficients, least squares, homoskedasticity,
                    linearity and mulicollinearity. I don't think that would've gone very well with a 9-year old. That's
                    something you can think of! How would you answer this question?
                </p>

                <h3 class="blue">3. Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my first posts was on various data science tools. You can check it out <a
                        href="./p1-datascience.html" class="link" target="blank">Here</a>. I won't go into too many
                    details, I'll just mention that the vast majority of data science problems can be solved with Python
                    (possibly R), SQL and Cloud Services.
                </p>
                <p>You'll most likely find yourself using SQL for data extraction and manipulation, so you should get
                    comfortable with at least basic SQL commands. <a href="../tutorials/sql-basics.html" class="link"
                        target="_blank">Here</a> is a high level overview of those commands. I think SQL shouldn't be
                    very challenging to learn for an absolute beginner.</p>
                <p>The reason why I would pick Python over R as your choice of language is mainly because of model
                    deployment. You can also check R/Python usage by industry and examples of problems that need to be
                    solved (statistical analysis vs machine learning) and decide which language to go with.</p>
                <p>Cloud Services wasn't really a requirement 7 years ago when I was applying for analytics jobs,
                    however, these days, I expect people I interview have at least basic familiarity with cloud
                    services. </p>
                <p>You'll most likely end up hosting predictive models or analytics applications that you built on some
                    server. It could be your company server, but chances are it'll be hosted on Amazon Web Service,
                    Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. </p>
                <p>You would want to get familiar with varies ways of deploying analytics projects into production. It
                    could be hosted on a virtual machine on a cloud, it could use containers or serverless architecture.
                </p>
                <p>There are other concepts that you could look into, such as cloud storage, cloud databases, machine
                    learning pipelines on the cloud, monitoring, etc.</p>

                <h3 class="blue">4. Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    There are tons of projects you can find on Kaggle and other places. I think it can be a great
                    starting point especially if you use these projects to learn. The problem is that there are also
                    tons of people working on these projects, so if you want to stand out, you really need to come up
                    with something unique which may be challenging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you pick a project? Is there something you are passionate about? If so, start searching for
                    relevant data and see if there is possibly a machine learning or data exploration project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter which project you pick, it should demonstrate that you are comfortable with every stage of
                    a data science project. Is there an additional data source that you can join to your main data?
                    Perhaps, there is an API and you can demonstrate that you are comfortable with making a request. You
                    can also show that you know how to join data together. Are there charts or relationships that can
                    demonstrate what you are trying to accomplish? Can you explain your thought process regarding
                    feature engineering and model selection? When you are building a model, perhaps, you can start with
                    something more explainable (regression or decision tree) and then proceed to a more sophisticated
                    machine learning methodology. Could you add machine learning interpretability to explain
                    predictions? Lastly, if you were to deploy this model, how would you approach it? Perhaps, you could
                    build a flask app that a user could run locally and provide a sample request that they could
                    experiment with. If you can ship it to the cloud or server, even better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may feel too much, but if you don't have a relevant educational or work background, you need to
                    prove that you are capable of working on a real life data science project, and what I explained
                    above is a good representation of one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some data sources that you could potentially experiment with.

                <h3 class="blue">Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Being a data scientist is a lot of fun. I like how much new stuff comes out pretty much every year.
                    It allows you to never stop learning, and if that's something you are in to, then you'll do just
                    fine.</p>
                <p class="last-p">I hope this was somewhat useful and keep learning!</p>
